‘Those who had Covid must undergo regular check-ups’
Indore: Patients who have recovered from Covid-19 should get regular check-ups irrespective of age to avert complications, including heart attacks that are seen of late in unsuspecting young people, said doctors at
“Covid-19 has been attributed to enhancing the pro-thrombotic tendency among the recovered patients.
Impact of Covid-19 is being researched. It is imperative that everyone, irrespective of age, should undergo regular medical tests for timely intervention and prevention,”
CEO and executive director Dr Santosh Shetty said.
Dr Shetty’s warning came at the first anniversary of the hospital in Indore – a city that has seen at least four deaths of youngsters in the last month due to cardiac arrest in Indore.
“Regular tests help in early diagnosis thereby helping doctors to start preventive or curative treatment,” he said, revealing striking disease patterns seen in the hospital's year-long health study involving 4000 patients under and above the age of 45 years.
